# what is this
Simple free api gateway, meant to be used for small simple projects that want a single place to handle auth.

## How to add endpoints
Endpoints can be added in the class com.api.gateway.reader.ConfigDefinition by adding an ApiModel class to the apis class member

## How to run the api gateway
1. Go to the root directory
2. run the following command on a shell './gradlew clean build run'

## How to secure endpoints
* Endpoints can be secured by setting the "isProtected" flag to true on the "com.api.gateway.models.ApiModel"
    * The api gateway will verify the signatures on the JWT with a signature that is based of a private key that is generated by the api gateway on startup, this means that all sessions will be invalidated every time the api gateway is restarted
    * A "/login" endpoint must be provided in order to return JWT tokens that must be kept by the client.
